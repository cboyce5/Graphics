How long did this assignment take?
This assignment took around 2-3 hours.

How much did the lab help for this assignment?
On a scale from 1-10, it was a 10. The lab helped a lot since before this 
I did not know how to do anything that involved shapes, transformations and colors.

How fun was the assignment?
On a scale form 1-10, it was a 7. It was a bit tedious at times to get the 
coordinates for all the shapes, but it was also diffidcut to test some fo the 
rotations as I was not familiar with the rotation syntax so alot of trial and error 
was necessary.
