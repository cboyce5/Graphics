Name: Cliff Boyce
Hero Name: Vorago
Assignment: Lab03

Q1: How fun was this lab? 
	8/10.
	
Q2: How was the writeup?
	It was helpful in telling me what to do, but the parts that took the most time (for me at least) could 
	have been avoided by adding an extra line or two. For example, I spent the most time figuring out how to read
	the values from the file while separating the commas. The instructor posts on piazza kind of aluded to the solution,
	but adding a simple hint such as "can be accomplished by reading in a dummy variable" would have saved a lot
	of time and frustration.

Q3: How long did the lab take you?
	3 hours, including time spent in lab.
	
Q4: Comments?
	Nope
