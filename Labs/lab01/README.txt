Name: Cliff Boyce
Hero Name: Vorago
AssignmentL: Lab001
Description: Adding keyboard and mouse interaction

Q1: Global variables, are they necessary?
This appears to be necessary as there isn't an apparent way to 
get data to and from the functions when the functions for the 
callbacks have a required syntax in terms of inputs and function return type.

Q2: How fun was this lab?
On a scale from 1-10, it was an 8.

Q3: How was the writeup for this lab?
The writeup was clear, the only thing that could have been better is clearly 
indicating when something is added or changed. Sometimes you talk in english 
and it looks like we need to change something, but in reality we change it 
in an another paragraph.

Q4: How long did this lab take you?
Less than 1 hour.

Q5: Comments?
None
